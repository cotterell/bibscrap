Overview

Bibscrap (i.e., the ``bibscrap`` package) provides semi-automated tools for the
creation of :term:`systematic literature reviews <SLR>` (SLRs). The methodology
used to find and review the relevant research literature when writing an SLR is
rigorous, often affording hypothesis testing related to real research questions
about the literature; however, that rigor also means more work for SLR authors,
especially when it comes to data collection and unbiased filtering.
