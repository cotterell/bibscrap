                                     ATTENTION!
                                     ----------

  Thank you for taking the time to request a feature! Before you
  start describing what you want, please make sure that it is unique. Please
  take a moment to search through the list of existing feature requests at
  the link below:

      https://github.com/cotterell/bibscrap/issues?q=label:enhancement

  If you do not find anything that matches your proposed feature, then try
  to think of other keywords that people might use, then try again.

  If you find that someone else has already requested the same feature, then
  do not just move on! Instead, please let us know that you are interested
  in this feature too:

  * Add a Like to the feature request to vote for it. This helps the request
    become more visible to the Bibscrap team.

  * Optionally add a comment with any insight and background you have that
    is not already part of the conversation.

  If an existing request for the feature you are interested in does not exist,
  then please continue to create your own by filling in the sections below.
  We have provided guidance for each section in the form of a comment that
  will not appear when the text of your request is rendered -- you can
  confirm this by "Preview" tab/button above this text box.

  Again, thank you! Many of the best parts of Bibscrap started out as ideas
  from the user community, and we are very grateful for each one. Thanks so
  much for taking the time to write up a thoughtful feature request.

## Abstract

<!--
  Provide a clear and concise description (~200 words or less) of what you want
  to happen and any technical issue(s) or problem(s) is addresses. A good
  feature request abstract also describes the context in which the feature will
  be used.
-->

(Write your abstract here.)

## Motivation

<!--
  Clearly explain why the latest stable release of Bibscrap and its Public API
  are inadequate to address the problem(s) that the feature solves.
-->

(Write your motivation here.)

## Detailed Description

<!--
  Describe the feature that you would like to see in Bibscrap. A good feature
  request description includes more detail about the context in which the
  feature will be used. It is easy to forget to write about context because you
  may already know it so well that it seems obvious! Just like any tool, though,
  the best improvements are made with a deep understanding of how it is used.

  If possible, please include:

  1. examples;
  2. impact description (i.e., its effect on users, number of users impacted,
     description of users impacted, etc.);
  3. any alternative solutions or features you have considered; and
  4. any other context or screenshots about the feature request that you think
     might be relevant.
-->

(Describe your proposed solution here.)

## Due Diligence

<!--
  Does the feature you are interested in exist in other software? If so, then
  what is it, and how does it work? Are there any relevant existing standards
  or conventions that may apply to your proposed feature?
-->

(Describe your due diligence here.)

                              BEFORE YOU SUBMIT!
                              ------------------

Please state your feature request title simply and succinctly. There is no need
to decorate the title of your issue with words like *Enhancement* or *Request*.
Use your feature requestâ€™s title to state your request as simply and clearly as
possible, with ordinary casing. This will help other people find it.

Bad Title:

    [REQUEST] Fetching references is TERRIBLE on WINDOWS, make it 2x faster

Good Title:

    Increase fetch speed on Windows 11
